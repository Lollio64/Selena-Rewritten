# Selena Rewritten
## About
Selena is the first complete GLSL compiler for the PICA200.<br>
Selena Rewritten is a rewritten version [Selena](https://github.com/machinamentum/Selena), a now sadly decontinued and outdated/unfinished GLSL compiler for the GPU.<br>
All files in the `examples` folder are there demonstrate the compiler.<br>
## How to build
Right now, you can only compile the compiler via a C++ 17 or above compiler (I'm not actually sure if lower versions work).<br>
In the future, I will provide a devkitPro Makefile to automatically compile the shaders at runtime.<br>
Or you'll be able to compile the shaders at runtime, via a libctru implementation or through compiling the compiler without the `main.cpp` file.<br>
## Contribution
Commit the your changes via pull request, make sure to document your changes in the pull and at best the in the source code via commits, so other commiters can understand your thinking process.<br>
